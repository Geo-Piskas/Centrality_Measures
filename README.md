Centrality_Measures
===================

A utility that efficiently calculates Closeness, Node Betweenness and Edge Betweenness of a given connected, undirected graph.

The implementation is based on [1] and was extended to simultaneously calculate Closeness and Edge Betweenness metrics as well.
Time complexity is O(nm) for non-weighted and O((nm + n^2)logn) for weighted graphs.

The program accepts input generated by the Pajek [2] software package with ".net" extension (saved as "Pajek Arcs/Edges (*.net)").
Using Pajek, you can automatically generate a variety of graph, or even visually design one.

The program generates four output files. General input graph stats, Closeness, Node Betweenness and Edge Betweenness values.

Note: Implemented using Linux - using some Linux specific calls.
